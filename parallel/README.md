Use this directory and its contents to parrallelise runs of the tracker or analysis script. Both can be used to submit jobs which each run $MAX_SERIES series runs. 

Job submission files are currently written for use on the SLURM scheduler on Compute Canada. The bash code will hopefully be transferable to other systems. 

Sample input files are given as *.txt. They are file name sensitive and are in the same format as used by the series tracker script /run/run.sh.
